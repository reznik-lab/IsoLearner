# IsoLearner GridSearch
## About
This branch is for conduting a GridSearch to determine the best model to use for IsoLearner

## Instructions
1. Install all dependencies
2. Create a directory for the .h5 model files to be stored
3. Create a directory for the model configs to be stored
4. Choose which paramters to loop through in model.py
4. Using either gridsearch.ipynb or gridsearch.py, conduct the search (if conducting a large search, gridsearch.py is preferable as sometimes juypter kernels can unexpectedly close).
5. Use round 2 (.py or .ipynb) to conduct round 2 of the search (Only if not all parameters were checked in round 1) - Doing a 2 round search will be faster than doing one large one round search.
